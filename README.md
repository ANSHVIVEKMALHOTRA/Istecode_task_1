## React To-Do List Application(ISTEcode Assignment 1)
This is a simple to-do list application built with React that allows users to add, complete, edit, and delete tasks. The application uses React state and functional components with hooks to manage the list of tasks and their statuses.

### Features
Input field for adding new tasks.
"Add" button to add tasks to the list.
Display area for the list of tasks.
Each task has a delete button to remove it.
Optional: Local storage to persist the to-do list even after page refresh.

### How to Use
Enter a task in the input field.
Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
To delete a task, click the delete button next to it.

### Local Storage
The application uses local storage to persist the to-do list even after the page is refreshed. This means that your tasks will be saved locally and will reappear when you revisit the page.
